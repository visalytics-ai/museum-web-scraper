# museum-web-scraper
This project scrapes the Met Museums website for images and descriptions of swords to build a database for a machine learning algorithm to identify the place and decade of origin of swords based on construction and stylistic traits. This scraper captures details not in the Met API. Check this space for updates on the machine learning progress.
